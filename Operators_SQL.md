- **Relational Operators** (such as =, <, >, <=, >=, <>) and **Logical Operators** (AND, OR, NOT) are predominantly used in the **WHERE clause** of SQL queries to filter records based on specific conditions.
- These operators enable comparisons and combine conditions to determine which rows should be returned by a query.
- Although the WHERE clause is the most common context for these operators, they are also used in other SQL clauses like **HAVING** (for filtering groups) and in **CASE expressions** for conditional logic.
